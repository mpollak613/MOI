In MOI, you will find methods such as Forward-Euler and Backward-Euler, Euler-Cromer, Leap-Frog, and an eighth order Runge-Kutta-Nystrom. I created this for my final project in a Numerical Methods course. The project uses numerical integration methods and explores their strengths and weaknesses in recreating the solar system.
